<p>Weight vests are a great way to increase the intensity of your workouts without having to spend a lot of money, and they don't take up much storage space.</p><p>When I started researching weight vests I was surprised at how many different options there were. Fixed weight, adjustable weight, plate carriers, flat plates, ergonomic plates, the list goes on and on <img draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/svg/1f631.svg" alt="&lt;img draggable=" /></p><p><!--more--></p><p>I've done the research my friends, and now you can reap the benefits. Read on for my thoughts on the best weight vest options for home fitness.</p><p>I've structured this article to include the recommendations up front for easy decision making. The recommendations are included first, followed by the requirements I used to make my choices and full reviews for each option. </p><h2>Best weight vest options</h2><table data-rows="11" data-cols="4" data-v="top"><thead><tr><th><p><strong>Brand</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>Features</strong></p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><strong>Rating / Best Use</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>Buy</strong></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-th="Brand"><p style="text-align: center;"><strong></strong><strong>Best Weight</strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Vest for CrossFit: Hyperwear Hyper Vest Elite</strong></p><span style="width: 100%;"><a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/hyperwear-hyper-vest-elite/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><img alt="Hyperwear Hyper Vest Elite Review" width="250" height="250" title="Hyperwear Hyper Vest Elite Review" data-id="4950" src="//fitnesstestlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/HyperVestEliteWeightVest-250x250.jpg" style=""></a></span></td><td data-th="Features"><p style=""><strong></strong><strong><strong>• Durable Cordura construction&nbsp;</strong></strong></p><p style=""><strong><strong><strong><strong>• Odor resistant wicking fabric&nbsp;</strong></strong></strong></strong><strong><strong><strong><strong></strong></strong>with reflective piping</strong></strong></p><p style=""><strong><strong><strong>• Thin profile allows full range of motion</strong></strong></strong></p><p style=""><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>• Flexible side lacing for highly adjustable fit</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p><p style=""><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>• Weight can be adjusted in 2.25oz increments</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p></td><td data-th="Rating / Best Use" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><span><img alt="Kettlebell Reviews Rating -

To keep things simple, I limited my choices to vests that could hold at least 20lbs of weight.</p><p>I mainly chose 20lbs since it's a popular weight for Hero WODs like Murph, but I also think it's a good weight that hits the sweet spot between not-to-light and not-to-heavy for most people.</p><p>I also limited my choices to the most compact designs I could find, in order to reduce the impact on mobility. No sense wearing a weight vest if I can't even do my regular workouts!</p><p>Here are the test subjects:</p><ul><li><a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/hyperwear-hyper-vest-elite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyperwear Hyper Vest Elite</a></li><li><a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/hyperwear-hyper-vest-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyperwear Hyper Vest Pro</a></li><li><a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/cati-armor-ergonomic-fitness-plates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CATI Armor Ergonomic Fitness Plates</a></li><li><a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/fringe-sport-tactical-vest-weight-plates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fringe Sport Tactical Vest Weight Plates</a></li><li><a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/rogue-cast-weight-vest-plates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rogue USA Cast Weight Vest Plates</a></li><li><a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/condor-sentry-plate-carrier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Condor Sentry Plate Carrier</a></li><li><a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/bcs-extreme-lightweight-plate-carrier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BCS Extreme Lightweight Plate Carrier</a></li><li><a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/mir-adjustable-weighted-vest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIR Air Flow Adjustable Weight Vest</a></li><li><a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/fringesport-wodmaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fringe Sport WODmaster 20lb Weight Vest</a></li><li><a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/hyperwear-adjustable-weight-plates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyperwear Flexible Adjustable Weight Plates</a></li><li><a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/hyperwear-tac-weighted-vest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyperwear Hypervest TAC Weight Vest</a></li></ul><p>I've either bought, begged, or borrowed all of them and put each one to the test. Read on for full reviews of each option.</p><h2>Full reviews</h2><p>What follows is a full review for each of the vests, plate carriers, and weight plates I've tested. For reference, I tested all of these options doing workouts with my office kettlebell club, or at home in my home gym (a.k.a. the Fitness Test Lab).</p><p>All of our kettlebell club workouts are <a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/short-kettlebell-workouts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documented here</a> in case you're interested in some single-kettlebell complexes designed to be done in 30 minutes or less.</p><p>I also tested these weight vest options while running, both outside and indoors on a treadmill.</p><h3>Hyperwear Hyper Vest Elite Review</h3><p>The Hyperwear line of weight vests are quite possibly the most innovative designs on the market.</p><p>The original Hyper Vest Pro introduced a design utilizing many small weights distributed evenly in pockets all over the vest, instead of fewer larger weights or weight plates used by competing designs.</p><p>The result is a vest that provides an amazing amount of comfort and mobility, in a low profile form that can be worn under clothing. I've worn this vest to work a few times under a cashmere sweater and no one could really tell it was there.</p><p>Or, at least no one mentioned it to me. By now my coworkers are used to seeing me roam the halls with all sorts of <a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/the-yoak-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strange looking gear</a>, so they may have kept their comments to themselves.</p><p>The Hyper Vest Elite is the second-generation design of the Hyper Vest Pro, designed for more intense use.</p><figure><img src="https://fitnesstestlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Best-Weight-Vests-for-Home-Use-Hyperwear-Hypervest-Elite-Vest-Review-Fit.jpg" alt="Best Weight Vests for Home Fitness - Hyperwear Hypervest Elite Vest Review - Fit" width="600" height="600" /><figcaption><em>Hyperwear Hyper Vest Elite fit - front, side, and back</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Hyper Vest Elite is made of Cordura, which is basically nylon with extremely high tensile strength. In non-nerdy terms, that means this fabric is <em>tough</em>.</p><p>Cordura may not be as stretchy as the material used in the Hyper Vest Pro, but unlike the Pro, there is pretty much zero chance of the fabric tearing through normal use.</p><p>I'll just get this out of the way up front - this is the best weight vest option I've tested.</p><p>It's comfortable, it offers unparalleled mobility, and the weight level and distribution can be customized exactly how you like them. It's also very easy to put on and take off, thanks to the zippered front.</p><p>However, I do have some nits to pick. Nothing deal-breaking, just stuff you should be aware of.</p><p>First, adding and removing weights is <em>tedious</em>. The vest comes loaded with 10lbs, and each individual weight weighs 2.25oz.</p><p>This means loading the vest up to a full 20lbs requires adding <em>seventy-two(!)</em> additional weights to the vest. Even with the insertion tool included in every box of weights, adding or removing large increments of weight is not something you'll want to do often.</p><figure><img src="https://fitnesstestlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Best-Weight-Vests-for-Home-Use-Hyperwear-Hypervest-Elite-Vest-Review-Weights-and-Insertion-Tool-Fit.jpg" alt="Best Weight Vests for Home Fitness - Hyperwear Hypervest Elite Vest Review - Weights and Insertion Tool - Fit" width="600" height="600" /><figcaption><em>Hyperwear vest weights and insertion tool</em></figcaption></figure><p>Second, the elastic cording on the sides of the Hyper Vest Elite are held tight using plastic spring clips, but the spring tension isn't strong enough to hold the cords in place during exercise.</p><p>I found myself having to retighten the cords multiple times during a workout, until I remembered a suggestion made to me by an employee at Hyperwear to tie a simple knot in the cord below the spring clip. I had no problems with the cords after that.</p><p>It would be great if the spring clip was stronger, but once you find your fit and tie a knot under the clip you probably won't need to mess with it again.</p><figure><img src="https://fitnesstestlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Best-Weight-Vests-for-Home-Use-Hyperwear-Hypervest-Elite-Vest-Review-Knot-Under-Spring-Clip-Fit.jpg" alt="Best Weight Vests for Crossfit - Hyperwear Hypervest Elite Vest Review - Knot Under Spring Clip- Fit" width="600" height="600" /><figcaption><em>It ain't purty but it works</em></figcaption></figure><p>Third, the fit is a bit long for people like myself with short torsos.</p><p>I use a medium sized Hyper Vest Elite and the bottom row on the back of the vest extends down below my waistline.

If you read enough online reviews for the Pro, you'll eventually come across someone complaining about tears in the weight pockets.</p><p>I can't speak to all of these complaints, but from what I've read they typically happen to people who consistently train hard with a full 20lbs of loaded weight.</p><p>To be perfectly clear, the Hyper Vest Pro is very durable and will hold up to intense use.</p><p>But, even the toughest fabric breaks down over time with consistent hard use and let's face it - some people are just more intense than others. You know who you are, you animals!</p><p>I like this vest a lot - the Hyper Vest Pro is the most comfortable option I tested, mainly because of the stretchy nature of the Pro's fabric. This vest feels more like a heavy article of clothing than a piece of fitness gear, and is even less noticeable under loose clothing than the Hyper Vest Elite.</p><p></p><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li><span style="color: #000000;">Very comfortable</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000;">Customizable weight distribution</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000;">Low profile design can be worn under clothing</span></li></ul><p></p><h4><span style="color: #000000;">Cons</span></h4><ul><li><span style="color: #000000;">Adjusting weights is tedious</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000;">Fabric may not hold up to intense use</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000;">Spring clip tension should be stronger</span></li></ul><p></p><h4>Summary</h4><p><div class="thrive-text-block"></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Hyperwear Hyper Vest Pro is the original Hyper Vest design.

Adding or removing bricks allows you to change total the amount of plate weight in half pound increments.</p><p>Each plate is loaded with 18 bricks, for a total of 9 lbs per plate. The bricks are held inside by a Velcro closure that is secure, but easy to undo.</p><p>With two plates and a weight vest, you could use these plates for Murph WODs.</p><p>The plates are comfortable and the design allows for some flex while you move. The ability to adjust the weight to my exact preference is a huge plus.</p><p>I was initially concerned that removing some of the weight bricks would cause others to bounce around in the empty space while running. However, that hasn't been a problem. The pressure of the plate carrier fitting snug against my body provides enough compression force to keep them in place.</p><figure><img src="https://fitnesstestlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Hyperwear-Adjustable-Weight-Plates-Review-Different-Views.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="800" /><figcaption>Adjustable in half pound increments</figcaption></figure><p>My only gripe with the Hyperwear adjustable weight plates is their size - these plates are much larger than steel plates and therefore they don't work with my favorite plate carrier, the Condor Sentry.</p><p>Given their size, there are a limited number of plate carriers that will hold these plates. They will work with the <a href="https://amzn.to/3KYl5Hj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TacTec 5.11 plate carrier</a> that is popular among CrossFitters, as well as the <a href="https://amzn.to/3qmVEpo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wolf Tactical vest</a>, which is roughly the same as a TacTec 5.11 but at half the cost.</p><p>If you have an existing plate carrier that snugly holds standard plates, make sure it can hold plates with dimensions of 10.25in wide, 12.25in tall, 0.75in depth before buying the Hyperwear adjustable weight plates. Otherwise you'll also have to buy yourself a new plate carrier.</p><p>I still recommend the Hyper Vest Elite over any plate carrier, but if you prefer a plate carrier and want the benefit of adjustable weights, the Hyperwear adjustable weight plates are a no brainer.</p><p></p><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li><span style="color: #000000;">Comfortable flexible design</span></li><li>Weight is adjustable in .5 lb increments</li><li><span style="color: #000000;">Can be "stacked" within a vest for increased weight</span></li></ul><p></p><h4><span style="color: #000000;">Cons</span></h4><ul><li><span style="color: #000000;">Larger than standard metal plates</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000;">Will not fit all plate carriers</span></li></ul><p></p><h4>Summary</h4><p><div class="thrive-text-block"></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Hyperwear Adjustable Weight Vest Plates have an innovative design that brings adjustable weight to plate carriers.

Bad, because like a backpack, I was never able to secure it well enough to stay put during running or jumping movements. There just isn't enough velcro on the adjustment straps under the arms to tighten the fit the way I want.</p><p>Granted, larger people might be able to secure the straps well enough to where it won't move. However, I tested the smaller of the two available sizes, and at 5'8", 180lbs I could never get the vest tight enough to avoid bouncing during runs or jumping movements.</p><p>Another drawback to being unable to securely tighten the vest was having all the weight supported by my shoulders instead of partially supported by my torso.</p><p>Have you ever had to run with a heavy backpack on your shoulders? The feeling of running with the WODmaster is very similar, although the weight is better distributed than a backpack.</p><p>The WODmaster is a decent option for adding weight to your daily routine, but I don't think it's suitable for running or exercises involving jumping movements, at least not for smaller people.</p><p></p><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li><span style="color: #000000;">Adjustable quick release buckles</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000;">Reflective stripes on front and back</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000;">Six points of adjustment</span></li></ul><p></p><h4><span style="color: #000000;">Cons</span></h4><ul><li><span style="color: #000000;">Weight fixed at 20lbs</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000;">Not a good fit for short/small people</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000;">Weight supported entirely by shoulders</span></li></ul><p></p><h4>Summary</h4><p><div class="thrive-text-block"></p><p style="text-align: center;"><b>The Fringe Sport WODmaster is the simplest design and most affordable vest of the options tested.

It doesn't take many bricks to get to 20lbs, so there are plenty of extra pockets left over to increase the weight up to 60lbs if desired.</p><p>The fit is good overall, but the torso straps design needs a rethink. The velcro for tightening the torso straps runs from front to back, which makes them difficult to tighten fully without another person pulling them behind you.</p><p>The MIR vest works well for WODs in general, although I'm not a fan of this vest for running.</p><p>The bricks have a tendency to bounce left to right while running, which as a man is very unpleasant and the closest I ever intend to come to needing a sports bra! <img draggable="false" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/svg/1f923.svg" alt="&lt;img draggable=" /></p><p>As for mobility, this vest always felt kind of bulky and awkward to me.</p><p>The bricks are as big as bars of soap, and since it doesn't take very many of them to reach 20lbs it's hard to distribute them in a way that feels natural.</p><p>None of the other adjustable options I tested had this issue.</p><figure><img src="https://fitnesstestlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Best-Weight-Vests-for-Home-Fitness-MIR-Weighted-Vest-Review-Fit_.jpg" alt="Best Weight Vests for Home Fitness - MIR Weighted Vest Review - Fit_" width="600" height="600" /><figcaption><em>MIR Air Flow Weight Vest fit - front, side, and back</em></figcaption></figure><p>I also think the MIR Air Flow vest was one of the less breathable options I've tested, despite having "Air Flow" in the product name.</p><p>I don't know what material the MIR is constructed from, but it feels like a thick nylon, close to denim in density.

I had no issues, but I could see where short people might have to remove the padding to get a better fit.</p><p>I found that it took some trial and error to get the shoulders adjusted just right for me, but once I got it dialed in I never had to mess with it again. The sides are secured with quick release buckles, so it's very easy to quickly tighten or remove this vest.</p><p>The shoulder straps and inside panels of the carriers are padded with a cushy mesh material, allowing for a very comfortable fit. I also like that there are velcro strips across the front and back that can be used for customizing the vest with hook-and-loop patches.</p><p>The Condor Sentry stays very secure during movements, including running and jumping. The shoulder padding does inhibit overhead movement somewhat, but otherwise mobility in this vest is very good.</p><p>Incidentally, this is a great weight vest to use for a WOD like Murph.</p><figure><img src="https://fitnesstestlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Best-Weight-Vests-for-Home-Use-Condor-Sentry-Plate-Carrier-Review-Fit.jpg" alt="Best Weight Vests for Crossfit - Condor Sentry Plate Carrier Review - Fit" width="600" height="600" /><figcaption><em>Condor Sentry fit, loaded with CATI Armor plates - Planet Express patch not included</em></figcaption></figure><p>I really like the Condor Sentry, I just wish it didn't look so...<em>tactical</em>.</p><p>I'm an engineer, not a veteran or a first responder, so I can't help but feel like a bit of a poser when I wear it, more tacti-<em>cool</em> than tacti<em>-cal</em>.</p><p>However, some people can really rock a tactical vest and look like a total badass, so if you're one of those people, kudos to you!</p><figure><img src="https://fitnesstestlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Dont-worry-Im-from-the-internet.jpg" alt="Dont worry Im from the internet" width="600" height="538" /><figcaption><em>How I feel when I'm wearing a tactical vest</em></figcaption></figure><p>Discounting the funny looks from people as I run around my neighborhood in a tactical plate carrier, this is an awesome vest.</p><p>When combined with the CATI Armor Ergonomic Plates (covered below), the Condor Sentry Plate Carrier is second favorite weight vest option and my top pick for a budget weight vest.</p><p></p><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li><span style="color: #000000;">Easily adjustable</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000;">Padded shoulders and panels</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000;">Customizable with patches</span></li></ul><p></p><h4><span style="color: #000000;">Cons</span></h4><ul><li><span style="color: #000000;">Weight plates must be purchased separately</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000;">May not work well for short people</span></li></ul><p></p><h4>Summary</h4><p><div class="thrive-text-block"></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Condor Sentry Plate Carrier is my second favorite weight vest option, especially when combined with the ergonomic plates from CATI Armor.

Take a look at the writeup I did for the Condor Sentry above for pictures of how they fit.</p><p>Combined with the swimmer's cut, these plates are hands down the best plate option for adding weight without restricting mobility.</p><p>These plates are so good that I'm sure it's just a matter of time before the broader fitness industry moves away from flat plates entirely and toward multi-curved plates.</p><p>In fact, it's already started - Rogue Fitness recently introduced their own curved plates (covered below), but they aren't nearly as good as these CATI plates.</p><p>If you happen to buy these plates, I suggest picking up a couple of trauma pads as well.</p><figure><img src="https://fitnesstestlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Best-Weight-Vests-for-Home-Use-CATI-Armor-Swimmers-Cut-Trauma-Pad-Review.jpg" alt="Best Weight Vests for Home Fitness - CATI Armor Swimmers Cut Trauma Pad Review" width="600" height="300" /><figcaption><em>CATI Armor swimmers cut Trauma Pads</em></figcaption></figure><p>Trauma pads are basically extra padding that sits between the plate and the inside of your plate carrier, adding an extra layer of cushion.</p><figure><img src="https://fitnesstestlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Best-Weight-Vests-for-Home-Use-CATI-Armor-Ergonomic-Plates-and-Trauma-Pads-in-Condor-Sentry-Plate-Carrier.jpg" alt="Best Weight Vests for Crossfit - CATI Armor Ergonomic Plates and Trauma Pads in Condor Sentry Plate Carrier" width="600" height="600" /><figcaption><em>CATI plate &amp; trauma pad, more cushin' for the pushin' (of weights!)</em></figcaption></figure><p>When these plates were originally introduced, they were only offered in a single weight - 8.75lb per plate.</p><p>This is a useful weight, but not necessarily the right weight for everyone.

I do plan to review this carrier at some point, I just had to draw the line somewhere to cut down on expenses for this article. </p><h3>RUNmax Pro Weighted Vest</h3>The <a href="https://amzn.to/2VUsQE2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RUNmax Pro Weighted Vest</a> is a popular option on Amazon and I thought about buying one until I started looking at customer photos of this vest in the Amazon reviews. The design looks big and bulky, not at all what I wanted in a weight vest. I decided to skip this one. <h3>BOX Weighted Vest</h3>The <a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/box-weighted-vest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BOX Weighted Vest</a> seems to be a popular option with CrossFit athletes, but it was too similar to the MIR Air Flow I was already testing. I may test this vest in the future if I can find a good deal on one. <p> </p><h2>Wrap up</h2><p>Like I said at the beginning of this article, a weight vest is a great way to amp up your training without a huge investment in cash or storage space. There are a lot of different options available, but only a few are truly versatile enough to be used for every kind of workout. </p><p>Whether you end up buying one of the options I tested or something else, make sure you know how you plan to use your vest and do as much research as possible before making a purchase. It's the only way to be sure you don't get stuck with a vest that doesn't suit your needs. </p><p>Do you have any questions I didn't cover or suggestions for other vests you'd like to see tested?
