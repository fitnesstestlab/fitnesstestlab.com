Combining air resistance with adjustable magnetic resistance, it offers an extensive range of intensity levels, making it an ideal choice for anyone looking for variety in their rowing workout.
<h3>Should You Buy a Xebex AirPlus Rower 4.0?</h3>
When it comes to investing in a rowing machine for home use, the Xebex AirPlus Rower 4.0 is a top contender. It's a very effective workout that is easy to use, and the dual resistance feature allows for a highly customized workout experience for people at all fitness levels.

This rowing machine is built to last, with a robust 93 pound frame. It boasts several user-friendly features that are often missing in other rowing machines, such as a comfortable seat, easy storage and transport options, and a vibrant color LED console.

<h3>What is the AirPlus Resistance System?</h3>
The Xebex AirPlus Rower 4.0 incorporates a unique dual resistance system, a feature that sets it apart from other similar rowing machines.

With eight different levels of magnetic resistance and a 10-setting damper for air resistance, you can dial in your workout to your specific fitness goals.

This is a great feature that I've not seen on other rowers, and one that I personally like a lot. The magnetic resistance helps build stamina, while the air resistance helps build explosive power.

<h3>Storage and Transport Made Simple</h3>
One of the standout features of the Xebex AirPlus Rower 4.0 is its foldable design. Despite its sturdy construction, the rower can be folded to less than 50% of its original footprint.

The rower is very easy to fold and unfold thanks to a single sturdy bolt design that snaps into place when you're ready to row, and releases easily when you're ready to fold.

Once folded, wheels on the base allow you to easily roll the machine out of the way.

In my book, the folding feature makes the Xebex AirPlus Rower 4.0 a top rowing machine for home use, especially when space is limited.

When folded, it takes up the same amount of space as my Rogue Echo air bike (<a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/rogue-echo-bike-vs-schwinn-airdyne-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full review</a>).

<h3>Easy Assembly</h3>
The assembly process of the Xebex AirPlus Rower 4.0 is straightforward, with all necessary tools provided along with clear instructions.

It took me about an hour and a half to put the rower together, working by myself.

<h3>Comfort and User Experience</h3>
The Xebex AirPlus Rower 4.0 is designed with user comfort in mind.

The rower's seat features extra-padded, high-density foam, ergonomically designed for maximum comfort during intense rowing sessions. The seat is also set at chair height off the ground, making it easy to get on and off the machine.

Moreover, the rower's fan design allows for a smoother, momentum-building pull with each stroke.

The fan baffle allows just enough air to pass through to feel like I'm rowing on a lake with a breeze blowing in my face üòÅ

Rowing machines, distinguished by their unique resistance mechanisms, offer varied workout experiences. Here's a concise overview of the different types:
<h4>Air Rowers</h4>
Air rowers, as the name implies, employ air resistance against a flywheel. The harder you pull, the greater the tension, providing a smooth stroke and limitless resistance for a rigorous workout
<h4>Water Rowers</h4>
<a href="https://amzn.to/3x7zoGH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Water rowers</a>¬†utilize water resistance. They contain tanks filled with water, through which paddles move as you row.

<a href="https://amzn.to/3x7zoGH" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone wp-image-7208 size-full" src="https://fitnesstestlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Water-Rower.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="377" /></a>

While they closely mimic the sensation of outdoor rowing, they lack the feature of adjustable resistance found in other types.

They also require periodic cleaning of the tank to prevent bacteria buildup.
<h4>Magnetic Rowers</h4>
<a href="https://amzn.to/4cueD88" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magnetic rowers</a> offer adjustable magnetic resistance, providing a broad range of tension. As you row, a magnetic brake exerts force against the flywheel.

<a href="https://amzn.to/4cueD88" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone wp-image-7207 size-medium" src="https://fitnesstestlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Magnetic-Rowing-Machine-300x286.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="286" /></a>

Unlike air and water rowers, the resistance remains consistent regardless of the intensity or speed of rowing.
<h4>Hydraulic Rowers</h4>
<a href="https://amzn.to/498tsun" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hydraulic rowers</a>, smaller in size than other types, primarily focus on an upper body workout.

<a href="https://amzn.to/498tsun" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignnone wp-image-7206 size-medium" src="https://fitnesstestlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Hydraulic-Rower-300x193.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="193" /></a>

They operate by pulling a lever, and typically, your legs and seat remain stationary.
<h4>Hybrid Rowers</h4>
The Xebex AirPlus Rower is a new type of hybrid machine that combine air and magnetic resistance, offering a more varied resistance experience.

<h3>How Does the Xebex AirPlus Rower 4.0 Compare To Other Rowers?</h3>
When compared to other rowers, the Xebex AirPlus Rower 4.0 stands out with its durability, construction, low maintenance, and ease of storage.

The damper settings and the magnetic system provide a lot of tension levels to play with, making it super easy to dial in your perfect workout.

The base sits nearly 2' off the ground, making it easy to get on and off, and the seat is well padded for comfort during long rowing sessions.

The fact that it folds in half for ease of storage make it a great option for workouts in tight spaces.

The console is bright with vibrant colors, tracking all the information that matters.

There are several built-in programs that can be run, including Interval/Tabata, Target calories, Target heart rate, Target distance, Target time, Quick start, and Competition racing.
