<h2>Introduction</h2>
The Rogue R-3W Folding Rack is designed to be a space-efficient wall-mount unit that can be easily folded inward or outward.

Rogue has created a unique hinge-and-pin system that ensures the rack is both easy to install and sturdy.

The Rogue R-3W Folding Rack features 2x3" 11 gauge steel uprights with Westside hole spacing and 2"-on-center spacing above and below.

The thick steel allows the R-3W to function as a squat stand, pull-up rig, or power rack with a level of sturdiness that surpasses lighter fold-back setups that use thinner steel.

It is compatible with most Infinity Series accessories and comes with a quick-attach pull-up bar, Infinity J-cups, and mounting brackets.

The rack is available in two depths: 20.5" and 40.5". I opted for the 20.5" version, since both arms can be folded inward.

I also bought the optional mounting stringers and safety spotter arms. I'll discuss those in more detail later in this review.

The base of each upright is covered with a UHMW plastic cap to protect your floor and allow the sides of the rack to freely swing in and out.

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;">In terms of dimensions, the Rogue R-3W sticks out about five inches from the wall when folded, making it very compact and easy to fit in most home gym spaces.</span>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">When fully assembled, it stands at just over 7 feet tall and has a depth of either 24" or 44", providing plenty of space for a wide range of exercises.</p>
My ceilings are only 8' tall, which is why I opted for a horizontal folding rack instead of one that folds upward.
<p style="font-weight: 400;">One of the standout features of the Rogue R-3W is its adjustable spotter arms, which can be easily moved to different heights to accommodate different exercises and users.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The spotter arms <strong>do not</strong> come with the rack, they must be purchased separately.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">However, I highly recommend them for safety when lifting alone.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you opt for the safety spotter arms, note that you'll want to be very careful not to drop heavy weight from height onto these arms.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you do, the force could potentially rip the uprights out from your wall, which would be no bueno.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Rogue R-3W Folding Rack comes equipped with a pair of UHMW-lined J-cups for holding barbells.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It also comes with an adjustable pull-up bar.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The bar is 1.25 inches in diameter and is knurled for a secure grip, making it perfect for pull-ups, chin-ups, and other upper body exercises.</p>
The pull-up bar includes safety pins with a locking mechanism, so if you're into kipping pull ups you can perform them without risk of the bar coming off the rack.

<h2>Daily Use</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of daily use, the Rogue R-3W has proven to be a reliable and versatile piece of equipment.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The folding design also makes it quick and easy to fold and unfold the rack, which can be done in about two minutes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The adjustable spotter arms and pull-up bar are also great features, as they allow for a wider range of exercises and support a variety of users.</p>
It is rock-solid and doesn't budge even under heavy loads, allowing me to work out safely by myself.

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to installation, the Rogue R-3W is relatively easy to assemble, though it was time-consuming to do on my own.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, it probably took me about two hours to put it all together.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The instructions are clear and detailed, and all necessary hardware is included.</p>
The wall mount stringers are unfortunately not included with the rack and must be purchased separately.

I debated whether or not to buy them, and I considered using wood for the backing mounts.

However, I thought the stringers would look better (and they do), so I paid the extra money for them.

I'm glad I did buy the stringers, since they add a nice extra level of stability to the installation.
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I was concerned about mounting the bottom stringer above the baseboard in my workout room, but thankfully there is enough leeway in the pin assembly for it to not be a problem.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the Rogue R-3W folding rack.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I highly recommend it to anyone in need of a compact and reliable power rack for their home gym.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It is well-built, versatile, and offers great value for the price.</p>
Bottom line, this is the perfect rack for a home gym where space is at a premium.
