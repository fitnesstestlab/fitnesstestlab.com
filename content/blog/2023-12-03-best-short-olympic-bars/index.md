<p>Is your home gym space a bit tight, but you still want to enjoy the benefits of a full-size barbell? Worry not, my fellow fitness fanatics! Several companies offer "shorty" Olympic bars, perfect for those confined spaces.</p><p>While some tradeoffs are made for the shorter length, a high-quality compact barbell can still meet the needs of most home gym lifters. I've personally bought and tested every short barbell from every major manufacturer to find the absolute best options for your limited-space home gym.<!--more--></p><h2>Discover the Best Short Barbells</h2><p>Short Olympic bars come in various sizes, including 4-foot, 5-foot, and 6-foot versions. In my experience, 6-foot barbells offer the ideal balance between compactness and versatility, as many of them can still fit on a regular-sized squat rack.</p><p>However, I understand that not everyone has enough space for a rack, and some just want to practice Olympic lifts, which don't require a rack. In such cases, a top-quality 5-foot bar would be a better choice. As for 4-foot bars, I don't believe they offer enough versatility to be worth your time ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p><p>I'll cover the specs I used to choose the bars I tested in the <a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/best-short-olympic-bars/#Requirements_for_the_Perfect_Short_Barbell">Requirements</a> section, but here's a quick rundown of the criteria I followed:</p><ul><li><span style="color: #000000;">Rackable, with at least 50" of bar width between collars</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000;">If not rackable (less than 50" of bar width between collars), does it have other standout features?</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000;">25-29mm shaft diameter</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000;">At least 300lb max weight</span></li></ul><p>I've tested every short barbell I could find that meets my requirements, but I'll give you the punchline upfront - <strong><a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/rogue-fitness-home-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rogue Fitness</a> is currently making the best short barbells for home fitness.</strong></p><p>Thanks to Rogue's affiliation with CrossFit, they've developed several shorty bars specifically for use at the CrossFit Games to allow more athletes to compete side-by-side.</p><p>Even if you're not into CrossFit, you can benefit from these innovative bars because they're built well enough to serve as most people's main barbell. Rogue Fitness shorty bars are an excellent option for those of us with limited space but still want to enjoy the perks of exercising with barbells.</p><p><strong>Full disclosure</strong> - I earn a small commission when you buy any of these products using my links, which helps me cover the costs of running this blog. However, I don't work for Rogue, and they don't send me any free equipment. I have to buy everything I test, just like you do. My reviews and recommendations are based strictly on my experience working with these products in my own home gym.</p><p>For those short on time or just want the TL;DR version, check out the table below.

Compromises have to be made to achieve a compact size, which typically means shorter sleeve length and less room to load weights, or a shorter space between collars which means the bar may not fit on a standard squat rack.</p><p>My goal with this article is to articulate the pros and cons of the most versatile compact barbells I've been able to find so you can make an informed decision about which tradeoffs matter most to you. For the purposes of evaluating and rating the bars, I'm considering factors such as price, build quality, and usefulness in comparison to a full-size barbell.</p><p>The majority of squat racks and power racks are built to accommodate a standard 7ft barbell, which has 52” of shaft length between collars. Most commercially available racks like the <a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/fringesport-garage-series-squat-rack/" data-eafl-id="5066" data-eafl-parsed="1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Garage Series Squat Rack</a> from Fringe Sport (<a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/fringe-sport-garage-series-squat-rack-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full review)</a>, are roughly 50" wide.</p><p>When I originally started my research, I focused primarily on short barbells that could be used in a rack for squats, overhead presses, and bench presses. This meant the short barbell needed to have at least 50” of shaft length between collars.</p><p>However, thanks to COVID19, I now know that many more people are working out from home who may not have space for a full-size rack, as well as people who want to focus more on Olympic-style lifts and/or functional fitness and don't necessarily need a full-size rack.</p><p>So, I'm also evaluating short bars that aren't rackable but still offer some extra benefit that makes them worth considering.</p><p><a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/rogue-fitness-ffl-lf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://fitnesstestlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/banner-leaderboard-1.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="90" /></a></p><p>Olympic bars, even compact shorty bars, come in several different shaft diameters. I limited my search to barbells with a shaft diameter between 25-29mm, since that’s the range best suited for a broad mix of powerlifting and Olympic lifts that would cover most home gym lifters.</p><p>The bar also needs to support <em>at least</em> 300lbs of weight. I picked this weight because it's within achievable range for most healthy adults who train consistently, especially on the big compound lifts like deadlifts and squats.</p><p>There are plenty of 6- and 5-foot bars available, but surprisingly few that meet all these requirements.

For reference, I tested all of these bars with a 140kg set of competition bumper plates.</p><p>When I first started testing shorty bars, I used a set of <a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/rogue-competition-plates/" data-eafl-id="3848" data-eafl-parsed="1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Rogue competition plates</a> (<a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/rogue-fitness-competition-bumper-plates-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full review</a>).  Nowadays I'm testing with a set of <a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/titan-urethane-bumper-plates-lbs/" data-eafl-id="4764" data-eafl-parsed="1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Titan Fitness urethane competition plates</a> (<a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/titan-fitness-urethane-bumper-plates-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full review</a>) after getting a good deal on them during a Black Friday sale.</p><p>Competition plates are the among the thinnest bumper plates available, and 140kg is likely the most weight any of these bars will be able to fit on the sleeves without moving to steel plates.</p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5735" src="https://fitnesstestlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Titan-Fitness-Urethane-Bumper-Plates-Review-Colorful.jpg" alt="Titan Fitness Urethane Bumper Plates Review - Colorful Plates" width="600" height="600" /><p id="caption-attachment-5735"><em>The test weights</em></p><p>For the sake of clarity, some of the bars include the word 'Olympic' in the name, but this doesn't necessarily mean they're intended to be used for Olympic lifting.</p><p>When describing barbell features, the term "Olympic" is often used as shorthand to mean the bar sleeve is 50mm (2") in diameter. A standard non-Olympic bar typically has sleeves that are 1" in diameter, so the distinction is important.</p><p>A bar designated as an 'Olympic' bar will be compatible with other equipment designated as 'Olympic', like bumper plates and collars. Refer to my <a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/barbell-buyers-guide/#What_is_an_Olympic_barbell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barbell Buyer's Guide</a> for more details.</p><p>I should also note that none of these bars is a perfect replacement for a full size barbell. They all have different tradeoffs, but I think the advantages of having a compact barbell for use in a tight space outweigh the disadvantages.</p><p><a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/rogue-fitness-ffl-dg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://fitnesstestlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/banner-leaderboard-1.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="90" /></a></p><h3>Rogue C-70S Bar Review</h3><p>The <a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/rogue-c70s-bar/" data-eafl-id="6557" data-eafl-parsed="1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Rogue Fitness C-70S Bar</a> is a relatively new product in the Rogue stable of barbells, built to the same specs as the <a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/rogue-ohio-bar-cerakote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rogue Cerakote Ohio Bar</a> in a smaller package.</p><p>This is the shorty bar I've been waiting for.  I mean that literally...

Granted, barbells are meant for work, not artwork, but it doesn't hurt that this bar looks cool.</p><p><img src="https://fitnesstestlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rogue-Fitness-C63-Stainless-Bar-Review-Collar.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="800" /></p><h4>Performance</h4><p>The bar's 25mm diameter is ideal for those with smaller hands or those who prefer a thinner grip. This, coupled with the dual markings, makes it versatile and suitable for a wide range of exercises. In fact, the thinner shaft and excellent grip make this an excellent bar for pulling exercises like deadlifts and rows.</p><p><img src="https://fitnesstestlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rogue-Fitness-C63-Stainless-Bar-Review-Knurling.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="800" /></p><p>However, with 43.25" between collars, it doesn't fit on a standard full-size rack, which limits the usefulness of this bar for powerlifting purposes.</p><p>This bar is meant mainly for CrossFit style workouts, so if that's what you need then the C-63 is a great choice.</p><p>The 25lb weight makes it an excellent choice for beginners or those looking to focus on form and technique. Its 190K PSI rating gives it a high level of strength and durability, making it suitable for heavy lifting sessions.</p><p><img src="https://fitnesstestlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rogue-Fitness-C63-Stainless-Bar-Review-Loaded-Sleeve.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="800" /></p><p>I was able to fit 65kg of weight on each sleeve, for a total load of 286lb. Add the 25lb of barbell weight and you've got a respectable total load of 311lb. Certainly not monster level weight, but plenty heavy for most home gym peeps like myself. If you use calibrated metal plates instead of the Olympic weights I used, a lot more weight can fit on this bar.</p><p><img src="https://fitnesstestlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rogue-Fitness-C63-Stainless-Bar-Review-endcap.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="800" /></p><h4>Best use</h4><p></p><p><strong>The Rogue C-63 Stainless Bar is a high-quality, compact barbell that offers excellent durability and performance for CrossFit style workouts. Its stainless steel construction and stylish matte black sleeves make it a standout choice for any home gym. However, its shorter length and reduced collar space may limit its usability for some exercises.</strong></p><p><strong>If you're looking for a compact, versatile barbell that offers excellent durability and performance, the Rogue C-63 Stainless Bar is worth considering.</strong></p><p><a class='btn light aligncenter medium' href='https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/rogue-fitness-c63-stainless-bar' target='_blank' rel="noopener"><span> Buy The Rogue C-63 Stainless Bar </span></a></p><h3>Rogue 29mm Stump Bar Review</h3><p>The <a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/rogue-29-mm-stump-bar/" data-eafl-id="7134" data-eafl-parsed="1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Rogue 29mm Stump Bar</a> is a testament to the adage that good things come in small packages.</p><p>A rackable, short-sleeve version of the popular stainless steel Ohio Power Bar, this compact barbell is designed with the same 29mm diameter, little-to-no flex shaft (200,000 PSI), bronze bushings, and aggressive knurl pattern.</p><p><img src="https://fitnesstestlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rogue-Stump-Bar-Stainless-Review-Endcap.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="800" /></p><h4>Design and Build Quality</h4><p>The design and construction of the Rogue 29mm Stump Bar are top-notch, as one would expect from a Rogue product.</p><p>The bar is made in the USA and the stainless steel shaft provides superior oxidation resistance. This means you won't have to worry about rust or corrosion, a common issue with many barbells.</p><p>The Stump Bar also features a new proprietary, matte-black finishing process on the sleeves. Unlike some bars that simply coat the steel, this process transforms the surface of the steel, increasing its long-term corrosion resistance and color endurance.</p><p>I haven't used this bar long enough to comment on how well the fancy pants black sleeve coating will hold up, but time will tell.</p><p><img src="https://fitnesstestlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rogue-Stump-Bar-Stainless-Review-Black-Sleeve.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="800" /></p><h4>Performance and Usability</h4><p>The Stump Bar, like its full-length counterpart, is built specifically for powerlifting movements. This is <em>not</em> a bar for snatches and cleans. If you want do so some weightlifting movements in a tight space, look at the <a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/rogue-c70s-bar/" data-eafl-id="6557" data-eafl-parsed="1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Rogue C-70S</a> instead.</p><p>The knurl pattern is described as aggressive, but I wouldn't describe it that way. I've owned and used several powerlifting bars with cheese-grater sharp knurling and the Stump Bar knurl is not like that.</p><p><img src="https://fitnesstestlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rogue-Stump-Bar-Stainless-Review-Knurling.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="800" /></p><p>In my opinion, the knurling is dense enough to provide excellent grip yet soft enough to not rip up your hands.</p><p>The stainless steel finish, combined with what I would call a moderately sharp knurling, offers a very secure grip for heavy lifts.</p><p>The Stump Bar is a fantastic bar for squatting, thanks to the inclusion of a center knurl that helps maintain a solid back position during squats. In fact, this is the only shorty bar I've seen so far that includes a center knurl.</p><p><img src="https://fitnesstestlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rogue-Stump-Bar-Stainless-Review-Center-Knurl.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="800" /></p><p>Though the shorter sleeve length (7.3125” vs 16.25”) reduces the amount of weight the Stump Bar can hold, the Stump Bar is still capable of handling over 500lbs with thinner plates such as Rogue's USA Olympic Plates or Calibrated Steel Plates.</p><p>In fact, I'm pretty sure this bar is meant to be used with steel plates, since I was only able to fit 60kg of competition bumper plate weight on each sleeve.</p><p><img src="https://fitnesstestlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Rogue-Stump-Bar-Stainless-Review-Loaded-Sleeve.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="800" /></p><p>The one complaint I have about the Stump Bar is the oddball weight.</p><p>At 30lbs, it's very non-standard and it throws off my plate math. I would much preferred that Rogue added just a little more length to the sleeves to get the weight to a true 15kg, but oh well ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p><p>Despite the odd barbell weight, there's certainly more than enough good stuff here for me to enthusiastically recommend the Stump Bar for powerlifting in tight spaces.</p><h4>Final Thoughts</h4><p>The <a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/rogue-29-mm-stump-bar/" data-eafl-id="7134" data-eafl-parsed="1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Rogue 29mm Stump Bar</a> is a fantastic compact barbell that doesn't compromise on quality or performance.

With a 25mm shaft diameter, this is a great bar for people with small-to-medium sized hands. More on this later.</p><p>Second, the weight. At 10kg (22lbs), this is one of the lightest bar of the test group.

The knurling on the Junior Bar is good, but no one would ever call it aggressive. It's just enough to provide grip without being too rough on hands that have yet to develop thick calluses.</p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4560" src="https://fitnesstestlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Rogue-Boneyard-Bar-Reviews-Rogue-Junior-Bar-Review-Knurling.jpg" alt="Rogue Boneyard Bar Reviews - Rogue Junior Bar Review - Knurling" width="600" height="600" /><p id="caption-attachment-4560"><em>Rogue Junior Bar knurling</em></p><p>The <a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/rogue-junior-bar/" data-eafl-id="4529" data-eafl-parsed="1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Junior Bar</a> is also the only bar in the test group with a black zinc finish. Zinc provides better corrosion resistance than hard chrome, but not as good as Cerakote or stainless steel.</p><p>I'm not a fan of black zinc as a barbell finish because it doesn't tend to hold up well over time. More often than not, it will often rub off or fade to green with use.</p><p>The grip that black zinc provides is also sub-par. When I use this bar I find myself having to use chalk when my hands get sweaty, and most of you will know by now I prefer not to use chalk if I can avoid it.</p><p>I initially thought the 25mm diameter would be too small for me to use, but I was pleasantly surprised.

This is a big deal, because it makes the bar much more usable for Olympic lifts.</p><p>The measured length is actually only 51.25" so saying it's a full-width bar is a bit generous, but it's still one of the widest bar lengths of the review group.</p><p>You might be asking yourself, "how'd they do this?", which is a good question. There's only so much real estate on a 72" bar (actual measured length is 71.5"), so they cut down the sleeve lengths to accommodate the full size bar length.</p><p>I didn't find the shorter sleeves to be a hindrance though. The bar will fit the full 140kg of weight, although I'm unable to use my Lock Jaw collars when I do this.

The hard chrome combined with the light knurl make this bar difficult to hold on to during deadlifts once I start sweating.</p><p>It also makes high-rep snatch sessions a little tricky, since I find my hands starting to slide outward when the bar is overhead. A little bit of <a href="http://amzn.to/2DZRNp7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">climbing chalk</a> helps the grip tremendously, but I don't like using chalk in my spare bedroom if I can avoid it for the sake of keeping my spare bedroom clean.</p><p>I would love to see this bar offered with a cerakote option for improved grip, especially since Fringe Sport has recently introduced a <a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/fringe-sport-cerakote-bomba-bar/" data-eafl-id="4141" data-eafl-parsed="1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cerakote-coated Bomba Bar</a>.</p><p>A slightly thicker knurl would also help, although that would potentially impact this bar's usefulness for high-rep work.</p><p><img src="/images/blog/2023-12-03-best-short-olympic-bars/Best-Short-Barbells-for-Home-Use-Fringe-Sport-Shorty-Bar-Review-Knurling-and-Sleeve-800px.jpg" alt="Best Short Barbells for Home Use - Fringe Sport Shorty Bar Review - Knurling and Sleeve" width="800" height="800" /></p><p>Despite the small size, this bar has room to grow.

Even though it looks and feels like a powerlifting bar, it's only rated to hold 250lbs.</p><p>Deadlifting over 250lbs is well within the range of achievability of most healthy people that train consistently, so the relatively low weight rating means this bar has a built-in limited lifespan of usefulness.</p><p>When I originally bought the <a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/cap-ultralight-training-bar/" data-eafl-id="3996" data-eafl-parsed="1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CAP Ultra-Light Training Bar</a> bar, the product specs listed the weight rating as 300lbs. If you'll recall from the requirements section, 300lbs puts the bar right at the limit of acceptable criteria for inclusion in this review.</p><p>However, CAP lowered the weight rating from 300lb to 250lb in the time between when I bought the bar and posted this review. <em>Boo!</em></p><p>What's even more confusing is their product website still says the bar will hold 300lbs, even though the specs on the same page clearly state 250lb. <em>Why??</em></p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4058" src="https://fitnesstestlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Best-Short-Barbells-for-Home-Use-CAP-OB-73UL-Review-Contradicting-Product-Info.jpg" alt="Best Short Barbells for Home Use - CAP OB-73UL Review - Contradicting Product Info" width="598" height="285" /><p id="caption-attachment-4058">Taken straight from the product page ¯_(ツ)_/¯ </p><p>I don't know which rating is correct, but I can verify this bar does hold at least 120kg (264lbs) of weight.

The first is the awesome knurling, which I already mentioned.</p><p>The second is the use of recessed welded sleeves. As far as I'm aware, American Barbell is the only company that does this type of precision welding, and this is almost certainly the only rackable shorty bar with recessed welding on the market.</p><p>The welds are recessed to avoid interference with plates resting flush against the collar. It might be overkill for a bar aimed at novice lifters, but I like it.</p><p>Third, the sleeve spin is the best of all the short barbells I've tested. The spin is buttery smooth and consistent, especially considering this bar uses bushings instead of bearings.</p><p>The sleeves also spin very <em>quietly</em>, which is unusual for a bushing bar. All the other bars in this test group produce at least <em>some</em> noise due to the friction of the shaft spinning inside the bushing.</p><p>Does the quiet matter? Probably not, although I think it does indicate a well constructed collar and sleeve assembly.</p><p>What <em>does</em> matter is the Performance Training Bar is a <em>true</em> training bar, meaning it's possible to train the Olympic lifts with this bar up to the limits of your ability (or to the limits of weight loaded on the shorter sleeves).</p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6459" src="/images/blog/2023-12-03-best-short-olympic-bars/Best-Short-Barbells-for-Home-Use-American-Barbell-Performance-Training-Bar-Review-Loaded-Sleeves-800px.jpg" alt="Best Short Barbells for Home Use - American Barbell Performance Training Bar Review - Loaded Sleeves" width="800" height="400" /><p id="caption-attachment-6459"><em>Sleeve loaded with 60kg and a spring clip collar</em></p><p>Speaking of shorter sleeves, there's only about 6.75" of loadable sleeve length on the <a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/american-barbell-10kg-performance-training-bar/" data-eafl-id="5055" data-eafl-parsed="1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Performance Training Bar</a>.

Eleiko has provided the barbells for several Olympic games as well as the majority of IWF competitions in the United States and Europe.</p><p>In recent years Eleiko has made a push into the commercial gym and home gym markets, introducing new bars such as the XF Bar designed for functional fitness.</p><p>The <a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/eleiko-xf-short-bar/" data-eafl-id="6487" data-eafl-parsed="1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Eleiko XF Short Bar</a> is built to the same specs as the full size Eleiko XF Bar but in a smaller package. Given that this is an Eleiko bar, the build quality is top notch. In fact, the XF Short Bar is so good it has taken the title from the American Barbell 10kg Performance Training Bar as <em>The Bar With the Best Build Quality™</em></p><p>The XF Short bar is a true 15kg bar, which makes plate math easier for those of you lifting in kilos instead of pounds.</p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6466" src="/images/blog/2023-12-03-best-short-olympic-bars/Best-Compact-Barbells-for-Home-Use-Eleiko-XF-Short-Bar-Review-Size-Comparison-800px.jpg" alt="Best Compact Barbells for Home Use - Eleiko XF Short Bar Review - Size Comparison 800px" width="800" height="400" /><p id="caption-attachment-6466"><em>Eleiko XF Short Bar size comparison with a 20kg Olympic bar</em></p><p><p></p><h4>Specs</h4><ul><li>69.61" total length</li><li>28mm bar diameter</li><li>15kg weight</li><li>3300+ lb weight rating</li><li>Tensile strength: 233K PSI</li><li>Needle bearings and bushings</li><li>Passive knurl</li><li>Dual markings</li><li>Chrome shaft finish</li><li>Chrome sleeves</li></ul><p></p><p></p><h4>Measured lengths</h4><ul><li>Bar: 69.5"</li><li><span style="color: #ff0000;">Shaft: 44</span>"</li><li>Loadable sleeve: 12.25"</li></ul><p></p></p><p>With only 44" of space between collars, the <a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/eleiko-xf-short-bar/" data-eafl-id="6487" data-eafl-parsed="1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Eleiko XF Short Bar</a> will not fit on a standard full size rack. This is a drawback, but the XF Short Bar has the most sleeve length of any short barbell I've tested and therefore can hold the most weight of all the compact bars included in this review.</p><p>As long as you don't need to use a full size rack, you can do any lift with this bar that you can do with a full size Olympic bar. The one caveat is that snatching with the XF Short Bar will be difficult if you use a very wide grip.</p><p>A full size barbell has about 7.5" inches of space between the edge of the outer knurl mark and the sleeve collar, while the XF Short Bar has just under 4".</p><p>So if you typically grip the bar just outside the outer knurl mark when you snatch, the XF Short Bar will work for you. Any wider and you'll need to go with one of the other short bar options covered in this review.</p><p><img src="/images/blog/2023-12-03-best-short-olympic-bars/Best-Compact-Barbells-for-Home-Use-Eleiko-XF-Short-Bar-Review-Collar-and-Sleeve-800px.jpg" alt="Best Compact Barbells for Home Use - Eleiko XF Short Bar Review - Collar and Sleeve 800px" width="800" height="800" /></p><p>Eleiko describes the knurling on the <a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/eleiko-xf-short-bar/" data-eafl-id="6487" data-eafl-parsed="1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">XF Short Bar</a> as being their 'least aggressive', and after working with the bar I would describe it as passive - you can definitely feel the knurling cross hatch, but it doesn't have much in the way of a bite.</p><p>This knurling is clearly designed for the type of high rep work typical in CrossFit-style functional fitness workouts.</p><p>The XF Short Bar is finished entirely in chrome, which I personally do not like in a bar designed for functional fitness. High reps mean sweaty hands, and chrome is hard to keep hold of with sweaty hands. I prefer not to use chalk in my spare bedroom home gym due to the mess that comes with it, but there's no getting around the need for chalk when using the XF Short Bar.</p><p>The sleeves have a very mild ribbing, and bumpers slide on and off easily. There is no wobble whatsoever in the sleeves, nor is there any slack that allows me to move the sleeves even a millimeter up or down on the bar. The XF Short Bar was clearly constructed using very precise machining tolerances.</p><p>The combination of needle bearings and bushings in the sleeves produce a spin that is smooth and consistent but not overly loose. It's a good balance for the typical mix of Olympic lifts and Powerlifting in CrossFit-style workouts.</p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6465" src="/images/blog/2023-12-03-best-short-olympic-bars/Best-Compact-Barbells-for-Home-Use-Eleiko-XF-Short-Bar-Review-Loaded-Sleeves-800px.jpg" alt="Best Compact Barbells for Home Use - Eleiko XF Short Bar Review - Loaded Sleeves 800px" width="800" height="400" /><p id="caption-attachment-6465"><em>Full 150kg weight stack loaded on the bar with room to spare!</em></p><p>The standout feature on the <a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/eleiko-xf-short-bar/" data-eafl-id="6487" data-eafl-parsed="1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Eleiko XF Short Bar</a> is the amount of sleeve length it has.

Like the recently released C-70S bar covered above, the C-70 is a cut-down version of Rogue's flagship Ohio bar. Unlike the C-70S, the C-70 is finished in black zinc instead of Cerakote, so I'm giving it a pass since <a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/barbell-buyers-guide/#What_is_barbell_finish" target="_blank" rel="noopener">black zinc is a sub-par barbell finish</a>. Get a <a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/rogue-c70s-bar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C-70S</a> instead. </p><h3 id="title"><span id="productTitle">CAP Barbell Olympic 2-Inch Solid Chrome Bar</span></h3><p>The <a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/cap-solid-chrome-bar/">CAP Solid Chrome Bar</a> is a sibling of the OB-UL73 bar included in the review, but rated up to 300lbs and finished with hard chrome. However, it only measures 36 1/2" between sleeves, meaning it can't be used with a rack.</p><h3>Hampton 6' International Bar</h3><p>The <a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/hampton-6ft-international-bar/">Hampton 6' International Bar</a> has only 48" of space between sleeves, so it won't fit on most standard power racks like those sold by Rogue Fitness and Fringe Sport. The 30mm bar diameter is also outside the sweet spot range of 28-28.5mm.</p><h3>York 6' Strength Training Bar</h3><p>York makes a line of <a href="https://fitnesstestlab.com/go/york-6ft-strength-training-bar/">basic strength training bars</a> finished in either hard chrome or black oxide. I couldn't find a definitive spec for how much length the 6' bar has between sleeves, but at 30mm the bar diameter is outside the sweet spot of 28-28.5mm.</p><h2>Wrap up</h2><p>All of the bars reviewed pack a lot of punch into a small package, and which one you go with will obviously depend on your needs, budget, and the compromises you're willing to live with. </p><p>Do you have any questions I didn't cover or suggestions for other bars I may have overlooked?
