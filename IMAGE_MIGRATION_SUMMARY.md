## Completed Tasks

### 1. Copied All Images from Source to Public Directory
- Successfully copied images from `.tmp/post/[slug]/images/` to `public/images/blog/[date-slug]/`
- Processed 35 blog posts
- All source images are now in the correct public directories

### 2. Verified Cover Images
- All 35 blog posts have valid `coverImage` fields in frontmatter
- All cover images point to the correct hero/title images
- All cover image files exist in the public directory

### 3. Fixed WordPress Image URLs
- Replaced all WordPress image URLs with local image paths
- Updated 31 blog posts with WordPress image references
- All images now reference local paths like `/images/blog/[date-slug]/[filename]`

### 4. Verification Results
- ✓ 35 posts with valid cover images
- ✓ 34 posts with all images working correctly
- ⚠ 1 post with 1 missing thumbnail image (non-critical)

## Missing Image

Only one image is missing across all blog posts:
- Post: `2022-09-16-best-weight-vests`
- Image: `HyperVestEliteWeightVest-250x250.jpg`
- This is a thumbnail image that doesn't exist in the source
- This image is only used in one table cell and doesn't affect the post's main content

## Scripts Created

1. `copy_blog_images.py` - Copies all images from source to public directories
2. `update_blog_frontmatter.py` - Updates blog post frontmatter with correct cover images
3. `fix_wordpress_image_urls.py` - Replaces WordPress URLs with local image paths
4. `verify_blog_images.py` - Verifies all cover images exist
5. `check_image_references.py` - Checks for broken image references in post content

## Next Steps

The blog is now ready for deployment with all original images properly migrated and referenced.
